<p>I was lucky enough to be sent to RAD Summit, in Deckers, Colorado, for a work conference in 2019. I learned a lot, in a beautiful location, and met some pretty rad people in the process. I was humbled to be able to document the destruction and rebirth caused by a recent forest fire that hit the area not long before I visited.</p>
