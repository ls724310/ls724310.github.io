    <p>Hey there, I'm a visual communicator from Southeast Ohio. I attended Ohio University where I received a Bachelor's in the Science of Visual Communication - Interactive Media, with a specialization in Media Arts &amp; studies. Most of my time these days is spent working with Salesforce Commerce Cloud SFRA. Outside of work, I enjoy adventuring, hiking, climbing, gaming, playing guitar, and taking pictures of my cats &amp; dogs. Catch me at the nearest state forest, foraging ramps!</p>
